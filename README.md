# Classifying Portuguese Wines
#### This project was made as a part of a group project at the Univeristy of Nebraska-Omaha for CSCI 4090 Data Mining and Warehousing.
#### Collaborators include: Ghaith Al Saifi, Rob Black, Caroline Gardner, Grace Howard, and Marcus Spotanski

Using the common data mining techniques of K-Means Clustering and Decision Trees, we look to classify wines as either Reds or Whites depending on the chemical makeup and properties of thousands of independent Portuguese Wines.

Using R, we observed defining characteristics of both Red and White wines from Portugal. To learn more, you can see the Final Report Word document in attached in the repository. Data was seperated into test and train subsets for cross-validation, and preliminary analyses were conducted on each group seperately (reds and whites) and the group as a whole.

## Key Findings
The main idenifying factor between red and white wines was their density, as was clearly shown via our application of Decision Trees. However, we also wanted to observe what other factors were significant, so by excluding density, we observed that variables related residual sugars and sulfur dioxide also played important roles in distinguishing reds and whites.
